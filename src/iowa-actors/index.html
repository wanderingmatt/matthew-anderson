        <p>In 2009, I was contracted by the University of Iowa to put together a showcase site for an upcoming graduating class of actors. I worked with the Head of the Arts and the actors themselves to ensure that the site fit within the university brand while highlighting the actors. The website was linked to in graduation programs; the individual actor pages were used by the actors when attempting to land their first gigs.</p>
