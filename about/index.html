        <h4>A Brief History</h4>
        <p>Currently searching for my next adventure. Most recently, I was Design Lead at <a href="https://about.facebook.com/meta/">Meta</a> where I incubated teams and products with a focus on communities. Prior to that, I was VP of Product at <a href="https://www.onehub.com">Onehub</a> where I built a profitable business, beloved products, and happy teams. Earlier on, I worked at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/likewise-software">Likewise</a> where I established their web presence which led to a successful exit. I ran a freelance design company for a decade. I co-host a podcast about video games called <a href="https://chips-and-bits.com">Chips & Bits</a>.</p>

          <p>I'm a pragmatic craftsman who loves to ship. A full stack designer, I am constantly learning and trying new things. I am responsible for every aspect of designing, building, and maintaining large-scale products. I advocate for web standards and accessibility. I work mobile-first with a responsive mindset. I obsess over tiny details, nudging closer to perfection with each version I release to the world.</p>
